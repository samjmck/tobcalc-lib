### Environment setup

There are a number of options when it comes to creating this environment:

#### 1. Use the GitHub Codespace

GitHub Codespace is a which is a VS Code environment in the browser that is connected to a copy of the repository and a virtual machine with everything already installed to start contributing. This includes Deno and the correct VS Code settings.

Navigate to the repository and click on the "Code" button. Then click on "Open with Codespaces". This will open a new browser tab with the VS Code environment.

#### 2. Cloning the repository and setting up the environment locally

Clone the repository and install Deno version 2.3. Other Deno versions may or may not work.

#### 3. Clone the repository and use the devcontainer

Clone the repository and use the devcontainer config. This will include all dependencies such as Deno required for a local developer environment.

### Adding support for a new broker 

To add a broker, you need to write a `BrokerAdapter` which takes a data `Blob` as input and outputs an array of `BrokerTransaction`. 

The interfaces for `BrokerAdapter` and `BrokerTransaction` are defined in `src/broker_adapter` as followed:

```ts
interface BrokerTransaction {
    date: Date;
    isin: string;
    currency: CurrencyCode;
    value: number;
}
interface BrokerAdapter {
    (data: Blob): Promise<BrokerTransaction[]>;
}
```

At a high level, you should view a broker adapter as a function that simply receives data representing the transactions from a broker/bank and converts that data into a format the codebase understands. The data the function receives is normally in the form of a `csv` or `xlsx` file with raw data wrapped in a `Blob` object.

Start with defining a function that implements the `BrokerAdapter` interface, as follows:

```ts
const MyAdapter: BrokerAdapter = async (data) => {
    const brokerTransactions: BrokerTransaction[] = [];
    return brokerTransactions;
};
```

The `data` parameter is of the [`Blob` type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob), meaning you can call methods such as `text()` to get the file as a string or `stream()` to get a `ReadableStream`. See `src/adapters/IBKR_adapter.ts` for a concrete example of how to process a `csv` file:

```ts
export const IBKRAdapter: BrokerAdapter = async data => {
    // Convert data blob to a string
    const text = await data.text();
    
    // Rows are separated by a line break or "\n", we want to split the string up into the rows
    // separated by \n
    const rows = text.split("\n");
    
    // The first row of a csv contains the names of columns
    const columnNamesRow = rows[0];
    
    // Each column in a row is seperated by a comma - we can get the column names by splitting
    // the first row by 
    const columnNames = rows[0].split(",");

    // Recall the properties of a BrokerTransaction: date, isin, currency and value
    // We want to extract these properties from the input data
    // To do so, we need the indexes of the columns of those properties
    // We can find them by looking in the header row with the column names
    const dateColumnIndex = columnNames.indexOf(`"TradeDate"`);
    const isinColumnIndex = columnNames.indexOf(`"ISIN"`);
    const currencyCodeColumnIndex = columnNames.indexOf(`"CurrencyPrimary"`);
    const valueColumnIndex = columnNames.indexOf(`"Amount"`);

    const brokerTransactions: BrokerTransaction[] = [];
    // Now we want to loop over all the rows except the header row, hence the slice(1, -1)
    for(const rowString of rows.slice(1, -1)) {
        // Split the columns of the row into an array
        // And then remove the quotes which encapsulate every column value
        const row = rowString.split(",").map(s => s.substring(1, s.length - 1));
        
        // Save date in a variable so we can easily reuse while creating a Date object
        const dateString = row[dateColumnIndex];

        brokerTransactions.push({
            // Date is in format YYYYMMDD
            date: new Date(`${dateString.substring(0, 4)}-${dateString.substring(4, 6)}-${dateString.substring(6, 8)}`),
            isin: row[isinColumnIndex],
            currency: <CurrencyCode> row[currencyCodeColumnIndex],
            // Number() to convert string into number and * 100 to convert into integer
            value: Number(row[valueColumnIndex]) * 100,
        });
    }
    return brokerTransactions;
};
```

Once you have written the adapter for your broker, you should add a unit test for it. `src/IBKR_adapter_test.ts` provides a good template or starting point for doing so:

```ts
Deno.test({
    name: "adapter converting csv to taxable transactions",
    permissions: {
        read: true,
    },
    fn: async () => {
        const data = await Deno.readFile("src/adapters/broker_adapter_test.csv");
        const brokerTransactions = await IBKRAdapter(new Blob([data]));

        assertEquals(brokerTransactions[0], <Brokerransaction> {
            // Depending on the example data in your file
            date: new Date("2022-02-02"),
            isin: "IE00BFY0GT14",
            currency: CurrencyCode.EUR,
            value: 1381_75,
        });
    },
});
```
